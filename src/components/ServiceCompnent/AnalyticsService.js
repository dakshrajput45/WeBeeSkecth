            We have started simple — code at GitHub and a PR-based flow with a
            single requirement — to have tickets split table to be delivered in
            1–3 days. This required some practice of story slicing, and it seems
            that a sense of visible fast progress is shown through the ability
            to move tickets to Done. This can be a great motivational factor for
            the team to onboard that idea.

            Nowadays, the choice of frameworks is really wide, but again, due to
            some experience with Flutter, we decided to give it a go. Within
            mobile development, one of the important aspects to better decide on
            is state management.

          The choice of cloud provider was purely based on existing expertise
          within the team. We already use AWS for other projects, so we decided
          to stick with it. For sure, it is increased possible to do everything in the AWS
          console, but as times go, things become a classic big ball of AWS
          console, but as times go, mud that everyone is terrified to touch, and
          no one remembers why this bit exists at all.
